# hello-world
My first GITHUB repository 01.29.2016
I'm using Viking School's online prep program to learn the fundamentals of building a web application. 
One of the first tasks was to use CLI to install GIT, GITHUB, and Heroku.
Now I am learning how to use GITHUB to save and share my code.
Please share any resources that might be helpful for a newbie such as myself.
