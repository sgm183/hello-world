My first GITHUB repository 01.29.2016 UPDATE:  line 8 begins additional text for the 2nd step in learning how to use GITHUB: "Creating a new branch"
I'm using Viking School's online prep program to learn the fundamentals of building a web application. 
One of the first tasks was to use CLI to install GIT, GITHUB, and Heroku.
Now I am learning how to use GITHUB to save and share my code.
Please share any resources that might be helpful for a newbie such as myself.

I took my first coding "class" 3 weeks ago on CodeAcademy.com
Going through the Ruby module opened my eyes to this fascinating new world of web application development and I've been hooked ever since.  
I've now downloaded Sublime Text 2, version control programs, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
